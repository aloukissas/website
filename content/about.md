Hello there! Iâ€™m Alex, an Athenian ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡· living in Los Angeles.

Iâ€™ve spent the last 10+ years in technology startups, both as an early hire and as a founder. Most recently, I had a brief stint at [Whatnot](https://www.whatnot.com/), where I architected and implemented the backend that runs [real-time auctions](https://thinkingelixir.com/podcast-episodes/051-live-auctions-with-alex-loukissas/) at scale (thanks, Elixir ðŸ’œ).

I first got into startups in 2011 when I joined [Maginatics](https://web.archive.org/web/20140628160659/https://maginatics.com/), where I worked on an [distributed file system for the cloud](https://alexloukissas.com/#), which was [acquired by EMC](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/10/28/emc_buying_maginatics_and_spanning/) in 2014.

In between, I co-founded a couple fintech startups in [wealth management](https://agentrisk.com/) and [college savings](http://web.archive.org/web/20180319000951/http://easy529.com/). I started my career out of grad school at [Cisco Research](https://research.cisco.com/), working on cloud computing and storage, connected vehicles, software-defined networks, and smart grid.

I moved to California in 2006 to attend the Masterâ€™s program in [Computer Science at UC San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/). During my time there, I co-authored a research paper on [data center network architectures](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1402967), which was recognized with the [SIGCOMM Test of Time Award](https://www.sigcomm.org/awards/test-of-time-paper-award) in 2018 and laid the foundation for Googleâ€™s [next-generation networking infrastructure](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub43837).

In my spare time, I enjoy ~~traveling~~ being a new dad, cooking, mid- and long-distance running, driving in the Los Angeles canyons, and working on various software side projects. Iâ€™m also passionate about [Krav Maga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga), which Iâ€™ve practiced since 2014 and currently preparing to test for the green belt.
